This instance is formed with the top 7 days (in number of services) for each one of the cities.
The top 7 days for each city (which might be different from city to city) are randomly assigned to one day of the week of 2025-09-08 to 2025-09-13. All the services of one day go to one and one day alone of the simulated week.
The seven days are taken from the whole historical data of sales.
